# Twitch URL Extraction Tool
## Project Description

The Tool is a powerful tool that extracts and filters live stream links from Twitch. It utilizes Java 17 with Spring Boot for the backend technology, while the frontend is built using ExpressJS with jQuery. The tool sends requests to the Twitch API, filters the responses, and presents the filtered results in a user-friendly interface. Users can easily click on a stream to open the raw link in a browser, or if accessed on mobile devices, the stream starts playing in a video player. It simplifies the process of watching Twitch streams.
